Hello, I'm Gowtham Gopalakrishnan (aka) GTS. I love to learn new stuff, hack into things and experiment with servers (who doesn't).

Also, while reading this blog please keep two things in mind:

1. Sometimes we think that we're right about everything, but we're not. So, I may have made some mistakes here and there and it is open to criticism and improvement.
2. I frequently change my mindset over a period of time. We may have a feeling about a particular thing at some point of time which may change in future. So, please ignore my opinions on technologies in older posts (only them) and make your own decision.

I currently work at <a href="http://cognizant.com" title="Cognizant" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cognizant</a> and I studied Information Technology at <a href="http://kongu.ac.in" title="Kongu Engineering Website" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kongu Engineering College.</a>

Things I spend my time on:

1. <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com" title="Hacker News" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>
2. <a href="https://www.reddit.com" title="Reddit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a>
2. <a href="https://www.quora.com" title="Quora" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Quora</a>
3. <a href="https://github.com" title="Github" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Github</a>
4. Movies and serials (Person of Interest, TBBT, 2.5 men, GoT, Silicon Valley, etc.. you name it...)
