It's been almost 7 years since I owned a computer and I'm grateful that it puts food on my table. I'm doing fine now with a full time job and currrently earning a little more than what I need to survive. This lavish life style is subjective and according to me I'm living luxuriously.

Sometimes, giving back to the needful brings us joy! So, starting from this year (2019), I'm going to give away 10 percent of my annual earnings to an NGO. I have not yet decided which NGO to donate to &mdash; fortunately I still have time till December and I asked the [help on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b1wlqu/askindia_need_inputs_on_ngos/).

I will update this post/write a new one once there's more progress on this.
